A Pokémon Emerald ROM hack.

Coming soon.

## The places may be familiar&hellip; but it's a whole new world.

It&rsquo;s been 18 months since Elio and Selene completed their island journeys and conquered the Alola League. **But when it came to beating Team&nbsp;Rainbow&nbsp;Rocket, they just weren't up to the task.**

In this globetrotting, alternate-universe adventure, the Pokémon world has fallen into the hands of the villainous teams &ndash; and it&rsquo;s up to you to reclaim it! Thanks to **Professor&nbsp;Magnolia** and **Looker**, you&rsquo;ve been recruited into the ranks of the Unova region&rsquo;s **Amnesty&nbsp;Institute**. Under their tutelage, will you have what it takes to defeat Team&nbsp;Rainbow&nbsp;Rocket and restore order to the world?

* **Revisit familiar locations from Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, Galar, Paldea &ndash; and beyond!**\* See how time and tyranny have affected the regions you know and love, and build a team of your all-time favourite Pokémon.

* **Complete story-rich missions and face off against the villainous teams!** Infiltrate, battle, and recruit operatives from Teams Rocket, Aqua, Magma, Galactic, Plasma, Flare, Skull, Yell, and Star. Uncover their true motives, and fight to win the citizenry&rsquo;s hearts and minds.

* **Encounter the mythical Pokémon Hoopa!** Discover the role it plays in the Amnesty&nbsp;Institute&rsquo;s plans &ndash; and the ReEngine system that&rsquo;s helping them stay hidden.

\* Content subject to change. Beta versions may lack certain content.

## New features

### Unlock the world with your Poké Pass

Checkpoints, curfews, and Poké Ball restrictions abound in this new world &ndash; and your Poké Pass is how you&rsquo;ll get around them! At first it&rsquo;ll give you access to Pokémon Centres and Battle Clubs, but you&rsquo;ll get regular upgrades as you rise through the Institute&rsquo;s ranks.

### Easier to read and easier on the eyes

We&rsquo;ve redrawn the classic Pokémon Emerald font to make it smoother and more readable. Where possible, we&rsquo;ve replaced harsh shadows with faux-antialiasing. We also tweaked the spacing to fit more text on each line, and increased text speeds across the board.

### A classic game with a modern attitude

We&rsquo;re leaving no stone unturned when it comes to quality-of-life improvements. That means a more streamlined introduction, optional reminders to save, and clearer language in menus. And you&rsquo;ll have the Running Shoes from the very start.

### Know your Mould Breaker from your Motor Drive

Pokémon games don&rsquo;t always do a good job of explaining their mechanics. Turn on our new Trainer Explainers and, next time a Pokémon breaks the mould, shudders in anticipation, or lays a curse on your Pokémon &ndash; you&rsquo;ll know exactly what to expect.

### Other features

* **Expanded battle mechanics:** We&rsquo;re taking full advantage of the [pokeemerald Expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion). So you&rsquo;ll encounter Pokémon, moves, abilities, and items that didn&rsquo;t appear in the original game.

* **British English:** We&rsquo;re British developers, so we&rsquo;re writing in our native tongue! Hope you&rsquo;re ready to visit the &ldquo;Pokémon Centre&rdquo; with us &ndash; that&rsquo;s the building with the &ldquo;red-coloured&rdquo; roof.

* **And many more features to be announced!**
